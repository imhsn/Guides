## Installing MySQL on macOS

Oracle's MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system that is based on Structured Query Language (SQL). It is frequently used in conjunction with PHP to enhance the capabilities of websites. PHP comes preloaded onto Mac computers, but MySQL does not.

When you create and test software or websites that require a MySQL database, it is handy to have MySQL installed on your computer. Installing MySQL on a Mac is easier than you might expect, particularly if you use the native installation package instead of the TAR package, which requires access and changes to the command line in Terminal mode.

## Installing MySQL Using the Native Installation Package

The free download for the Mac is the MySQL Community Server edition.

1. Go to the [MySQL website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) and download the latest version of MySQL for MacOS. Select the native package DMG archive version, not the compressed TAR version.

2. Click the **Download** button next to the version you choose.

3. You are prompted to sign up for an Oracle Web Account, but unless you want one, click **No thanks, just start my download**.

4. In your downloads folder, find and double-click the **file icon** to mount the `.dmg` archive, which contains the installer.

5. Double-click the icon for the **MySQL package installer**.

6. Read the opening dialog screen and click **Continue** to begin the installation.

7. Read the license terms. Click **Continue** and then **Agree** to continue.

8. Click **Install**.

9. **Record the temporary password** that displays during the installation process. This password cannot be recovered. You must save it. After you log in to MySQL, you are prompted to create a new password.

10. Press **Close** on the Summary screen to complete the installation.

The MySQL webpage contains documentation, instructions and change history for the software. 

## How to Start My SQL on a Mac

The MySQL server is installed on the Mac, but it does not load by default. Start MySQL by clicking **Start** using the MySQL Preference Pane, which was installed during the default installation. You can configure MySQL to automatically start when you turn on your computer using the MySQL Preference Pane.
