Java Guide
==========

For those of you learning Java for the first time, Java is a Class-based Object\
Oriented programming language, with similar syntax to C++. It is among the most popular languages with particularly heavy use in enterprise applications.

One of the major benefits of the Java programming language is that code is\
compiled into "Java Byte Code" which can then run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) available.

Below is a list of free courses and books which you can use to learn/review Java.

**How to go through these resources**

-   If you are new to Java and many of its concepts, I recommend you start out with the "Think Java" book and then look at the advanced topics in "Introduction to Programming using Java, Seventh Edition" book.
-   If you want a refresher of Java concepts, start with the MIT course "Java Preparation", if there are concepts you are not familiar with, look them up in the two book resources, in particular, the "Introduction to Progamming using Java, Seventh Edition" is an in-depth look at many of these topics.
